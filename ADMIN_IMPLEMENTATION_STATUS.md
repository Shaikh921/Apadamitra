## 📋 What Will Be Implemented

### Dam Management:
1. List all dams from database
2. Add new dam form (Name, State, River, Location, Capacity, etc.)
3. Edit existing dam
4. Delete dam
5. Update water levels
6. Search and filter

### Alert Management:
1. Create new alert form
2. Set severity (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
3. Send push notifications to all users
4. View all alerts
5. Deactivate alerts

**Should I proceed with full implementation now?**

This is a significant amount of code (~500-800 lines). 

**Alternative:** I can implement just the essential features first (Add Dam, Create Alert) and expand later.

**What would you prefer?**
